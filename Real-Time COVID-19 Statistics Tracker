4)Problem 4: Real-Time COVID-19 Statistics Tracker
Scenario:
You are developing a real-time COVID-19 statistics tracking application for a healthcare organization. The application should provide up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
Tasks:
1. Model the data flow for fetching COVID-19 statistics from an external API and displaying it to the user.
2. Implement a Python application that integrates with a COVID-19 statistics API (e.g., disease.sh) to fetch real-time data.
3. Display the current number of cases, recoveries, and deaths for a specified region.
4. Allow users to input a region (country, state, or city) and display the corresponding COVID-19 statistics.
Deliverables:
Data flow diagram illustrating the interaction between the application and the API.
Pseudocode and implementation of the COVID-19 statistics tracking application.
Documentation of the API integration and the methods used to fetch and display COVID- 19 data.
Explanation of any assumptions made and potential improvements.

COVIS-19 STATISTICS TRACKING APPLICATION:-

            else:
                print(f"Error fetching data: {data['message']}")

            # Extract relevant COVID-19 statistics
            cases = data.get('cases', 'N/A')
            deaths = data.get('deaths', 'N/A')
            recovered = data.get('recovered', 'N/A')
            active = data.get('active', 'N/A')

            # Displaying COVID-19 statistics
            print(f"COVID-19 Statistics:")
            print(f"Total Cases: {cases}")
            print(f"Total Deaths: {deaths}")
            print(f"Total Recovered: {recovered}")
            print(f"Active Cases: {active}")
        else:
            print("No COVID-19 data available for the specified region.")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tracker = Covid19StatisticsTracker()
    region = input("Enter country name (leave blank for global stats): ")
    covid_data = tracker.fetch_covid_stats(region)
    tracker.display_covid_stats(covid_data)

Documentation
API Integration and Methods
API Integration:

The application integrates with the disease.sh COVID-19 API to fetch real-time statistics.
Constructs the API request dynamically based on user input (country name) to fetch statistics for a specific region or global statistics.
Fetch COVID-19 Statistics (fetch_covid_stats method):

Sends an HTTP GET request to the appropriate endpoint (/all for global stats or /countries/{country} for country-specific stats).
Handles JSON response to extract COVID-19 statistics including total cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases.
Display COVID-19 Statistics (display_covid_stats method):

Parses JSON response to extract and display relevant COVID-19 statistics.
Handles cases where no data is available for the specified region.
